Example:
    const average = await prisma.posts.aggregate({
        avg: {
            value: true
        }
    });
    console.log("Average Value:", average.value);




2. How to calculate count with Prisma?
Answer: To count the number of records in a table, we can use the count method.
Example:
    const count = await prisma.posts.count();
    console.log("Total Posts:", count);




3. How to return all published posts in ascending order with Prisma?
Answer: Returning all published posts in ascending order with Prisma, we can do ascending order of posts with column publishedAt.
Where publishedAt is the timestamp of publication date.
Example:
    const publishedPosts = await prisma.posts.findMany({
        where: {
            published: true
        },
        orderBy: {
            publishedAt: 'asc'
        }
    });
    console.log("Published Posts:", publishedPosts);




4. How to extract data with groupBy using Prisma?
Answer: To extract data based on a specific column, we can use the groupBy method. 
Example:
    const groupedData = await prisma.posts.groupBy({
        by: ['userId'],
        count: true
    });
    console.log("Grouped Data:", groupedData);

This will group the data based on the userId and provide a count of each group.




5. How to delete a lot of data at once with Prisma?
Answer: To delete multiple records that meet certain criteria, we can use the deleteMany method.
Example:
    const deletedRecords = await prisma.posts.deleteMany({
        where: {
            userId: 7,
        },
    });
    console.log("Deleted Records:", deletedRecords);
