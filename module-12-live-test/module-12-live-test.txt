Question

1) How to Disable/Enable reactStrictMode in NextJS
2) Set basePath “/newProject”. That means “http://localhost:3000/newProject” is your home page path.
3) You have a security key like “key@123”. Now to use it by env in NextJS. And show how to use it in your application.
4) When you run this commend “next build”. The build file generate “newBuild” folder.

Answer

1. In Next.js, we can enable or disable reactStrictMode by modifying the next.config.js file.
By default, reactStrictMode is enabled. To disable it we have to: 

    const nextConfig = {
        reactStrictMode: false,
    }
    module.exports = nextConfig



2. To set "/newProject" basePath in Next.js, we need to configure the next.config.js as:

    const nextConfig = {
        basePath: '/newProject',
    }
    module.exports = nextConfig

Now “http://localhost:3000/newProject” will be the base path.



3. To use environment variables in Next.js, we can create a ".env" file at the root of your project. And set a value like below:
    SECURITY_KEY = key@123

Now we can access the variable as below:
    const securityKey = process.env.SECURITY_KEY 
    console.log(securityKey); // output: "key@123"

There is another way without creating an env file, that is:
    const nextConfig = {
        env: {
            SECURITY_KEY: 'key@123',
        },
    }
    module.exports = nextConfig

Now we can access the variable same as above.



4. When running this command “next build” to generate build files in "newBuild" folder, we have to configure the next.config.js as:
    const nextConfig = {
        distDir: 'newBuild',
    }
    module.exports = nextConfig

With this configuration, "next build" will generate the build files in the newBuild folder.
